Alyk met with Brent Baggs, Investigator for Davis County, on\nFebruary 14, 2018, at the office of his attorney, Todd Sessions.\n\nDuring this meeting, Alyk confessed to having participated in viewing,\nmanufacturing, and distributing child pornography from the time he was 14 until\nhe was 17. Additionally, he revealed that he confessed to his religious leaders\non at least two occasions, including once eight months prior to turning himself\nin. According to court documents, those leaders “had not made a report to law\nenforcement.”\n\nThe Crime\nAccording to an Affidavit for Search Warrant\n[https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/documents/c/c8/2018-04-04-AFFADAVIT_FOR_SEARCH_WARRANT.pdf] \nobtained by Truth & Transparency Benjamin Alyk confessed to having stumbled\nacross a website that acted as an image-sharing community for pedophiles. Alyk\ntold Investigator Baggs that when he was either 14 or 15 years old the security\non the site began to increase and, in order to obtain new material, he would be\nrequired to share child pornography in order to receive it in return.\n\nThis new security development led him to use a Flip Video\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Video] camera he received for his birthday\nto capture videos of two children, 4 and 6 years old, going to the bathroom. He\nclaims he made three videos of them and traded them for child pornography before\neventually deleting them from his devices.\n\nSome time later, when he was 15 or 16, he received a GoPro\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro] camera for Christmas and discovered that\nhe could control it remotely. He set up the camera to secretly record children\nwho were in the care of his mother in her in-home daycare.\n\nWith his hidden camera, Alyk says he filmed four different children, ages 4 to\n6, changing in and out of their swimsuits and using the bathroom. He traded\nthese videos online for links to child pornography.\n\nAlyk claims to have stopped viewing child pornography at the age of 17 and\ntransitioned to only viewing pornography with participants who were 18 years and\nolder until the time he left on his Mormon mission in October 2016, just one\nmonth shy of his 19th birthday.\n\nConfession to Church Leaders\nOn June 26, 2016, Alyk received a letter from the Mormon Church, officially The\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, calling him to serve a two-year\nmission in the Dominican Republic. The letter indicated he would report to the\nchurch’s Missionary Training Center on October 26, 2016.\n\nSometime in late November or early December of that year, Alyk arrived to the\nDominican Republic Santo Domingo West Mission, then presided over by President\nJames Hunter Nuckols\n[https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2014-03-29/new-mission-presidents-40511].\nAccording to the Affidavit for Search Warrant, Alyk confessed to Nuckols in\nDecember 2016, sharing with him the same details discussed with Investigator\nBraggs. Alyk was immediately sent home to Utah.\n\nAfter coming home, Ayk confessed to his local church leaders and ultimately went\nbefore a disciplinary council in June of 2017, eight months before turning\nhimself in to authorities. He was living with his parents.

Oaks of the First Presidency of the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly referred to as the Mormon Church,\ntook to the stand and rescinded a policy that caused a massive uproar in\nMormonism.\n\nLeaked with the help of Truth & Transparency co-founder, Ryan McKnight, in\nNovember 2015, the policy in question has since been referred to as the\n“November policy” and sometimes as the “policy of exclusion”.\n\nThe policy [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/us/mormons-gay-marriage.html] \nnamed all gay Mormon couples apostates and forbade their children from being\nbaptized until the age of 18. The announcement garnered national media attention\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/us/mormon-resignations-put-support-for-gays-over-fealty-to-faith.html] \nand caused many to resign from the Church\n\nOn April 4, 2019, President Oaks altered the policy. In a statement released by\nthe Church\n[https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/first-presidency-messages-general-conference-leadership-session-april-2019#oaks]\n’s Newsroom\n[https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/first-presidency-messages-general-conference-leadership-session-april-2019#oaks]\n, Oaks stated that that “children of parents who identify themselves as lesbian,\ngay, bisexual or transgender may be baptized without First Presidency approval.”\n\nHe added that, while gay marriage is still viewed as a “serious transgression”\nthose that are married are no longer apostates. According to the Church’s\nhandbook, the label of apostasy warrants excommunication.\n\nThe rescission of the policy created as large a shock as its implementation.\nHundreds of Mormons took to social media to express their surprise, praise, and\nexcitement. However, the reaction in the LGBT community did not express the same\nsentiments.\n\nWeston Clark, board member of Equ [https://www.equalityutah.org/]ality Utah\n[https://www.equalityutah.org/] compared the Church's actions to gardening in a\nstatement made to ABC4 News\n[https://www.abc4.com/news/local-news/utah-lgbtq-community-reacts-to-church-policy-changes/1900975179]\n.

He gave her copy of the book only for it to be returned\na few days later by her husband, Derwin, a fellow surgeon at the base. Derwin\ndid not express much interest in learning more about the book.\n\nAccording to the story, Nelson pressed and convinced the Ashcrafts to read the\nentire book. The couple was eventually baptized by Nelson. Derwin died a few\nyears later and Beverley remarried.\n\nApparently, sometime shortly after Nelson became an Apostle in 1984, he spoke at\na Stake Conference in Tennessee. While at this Stake Conference, Nelson was\ndrawn to a woman he saw in the crowd wearing a hat. While he was giving his talk\nfrom the pulpit he called her out in the crowd and asked how long she had been a\nmember and who baptized her. She responded that he baptized her in 1951. The\nwoman was Beverly.\n\nThe story goes on to describe how Nelson asked Beverly, ”How many people\nconnected with you have come into the Church since I baptized you?” Astonished,\nshe revealed a dream she had the night before in which someone at the conference\nasked her that very question. Because of the dream she came prepared with a\npiece of paper in her purse with the answer to the question.\n\nAccording to Leslie and Katie McKenzie, daughter and granddaughter of Derwin and\nBeverley (whose name is spelled wrong in the LDS Living article), that is not\nwhat happened.\n\nIn a phone interview with Truth & Transparency, Leslie and Katie, told the real\nstory behind their mother and grandmother’s conversion, a conversion story that\nhas been a source of pride in their family for nearly seven decades.\n\nLeslie and Katie say that their family have always been proud that their first\nexposure to Mormonism was through Nelson, the man who would later become\nPresident of the Church. They saw him as a spiritual giant, great leader, and\nthe man that changed the legacy of their family forever.\n\nThey were aware that Nelson occasionally used the story of Derwin and Beverley\nas a faith promoting example of missionary work. The story even appeared in a \n1984 Ensign article\n[https://www.lds.org/study/ensign/1984/06/elder-russell-m-nelson-applying-divine-laws?lang=eng] \nand in Nelson’s biography\n[https://www.lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/what-are-prophets/bio/russell-m-nelson?lang=eng] \non lds.org. However, in these versions, there is no mention of Korea, Beverley\nbeing a nurse, or a serendipitous encounter at a stake conference in Tennessee.\n\nAccording to Leslie and Katie, Beverley was never a nurse, she never lived in\nKorea, and she didn’t know Nelson until her husband introduced her to him.\n\nDerwin met Nelson when the two were working at Walter Reed Army Military Medical\nCenter in Washington D.C.. They were both doctors performing research, Derwin a\nveterinarian and Nelson a medical doctor. They became friends and Nelson later\nmet Beverley who worked in the same hospital as a transcriptionist. Nelson\nintroduced them to the Mormon Church and baptized them.\n\nThere was an encounter in the 1980s at a stake conference. Shortly after Nelson\nwas called to be an Apostle, he traveled to Knoxville to speak at the\nconference. Leslie and Katie were both living with Beverley in Knoxville at the\ntime. When they heard Nelson was coming to town they made sure to attend.\n\nThey remember that Nelson was aware of who Beverley was and knew she was in\nattendance. He did call her up to the podium during his talk and told everyone\nabout her baptism story and about how there are many members of the church today\nas a result of her conversion.\n\nThere was no dream the night before, there was not a prepared note in her purse,\nand there was no confusion on the part of Nelson as to who she was. Katie adds\nthat her grandmother ”has never worn a hat to church and did not have a hat on\nthat day.”\n\nKatie was first made aware of this new version of the story in early March when\na family member sent her a screenshot of the article. She showed it to her\nmother and, when she realized that it was part of an upcoming book, immediately\nreached out to Deseret Book and LDS Living. She sent both companies a document\nwith annotations pointing out the incorrect information.\n\nKatie was eventually contacted by a representative from Deseret Book and another\nfrom LDS Living. The representative from Deseret Book thanked her for bringing\nthis to their attention and that since it was so close to the release date they\nwould just remove the story entirely instead of trying to fix it. The\nrepresentative told Katie that this would require a reprinting of at least some\nof the books as the final printing process had already begun.\n\nThe representative from LDS Living told Katie that portion of the article would\nnot appear in the online version\n[http://www.ldsliving.com/What-Helped-a-Young-Russell-Nelson-Realize-the-Gospel-Was-Missing-from-His-Life/s/90444]\n, but did not say whether or not a retraction would be printed in the next\nissue.\n\nRequests for comment from both Deseret Book and LDS Living have gone unanswered.\n\nWhen asked why she felt the need to take it upon herself to correct the record,\nKatie says that her “main concern was the fact that people were reading this\naccount and believing it to be accurate when it isn't.”  Her grandmother is\nstill alive and she is worried about people in her ward reading the story and\nasking her about it, thus putting her in a position to have to lie or disparage\nNelson, a man she loves and reveres.\n\nLeslie and Katie also felt that the story, as it appeared in LDS Living,\nunfairly painted Derwin in a bad light, making it seem like he was dismissive of\nhis wife and the Book of Mormon that was gifted by Nelson. He is not alive to\ndefend himself and Katie felt it her duty to defend her grandfather from a false\nnarrative.\n\nLeslie and Katie harbor no ill will toward Nelson, nor do they think he owes\nthem an apology. They hope that LDS Living prints a retraction and that better\nfact checking is done in the future before putting stories like this in books\nthat are meant to be read by millions of people.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate April 10, 2019: This article originally claimed that Nelson met the\nAshcrafts at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.\nThis has been corrected to the Walter Reed Army Military Medical Center in\nWashington D.C..

Less than 24 hours\nlater, the manual was leaked\n[https://www.jehovahs-witness.com/topic/6255453529964544/2019-elders-manual-whole-lot-more] \nand seemingly non-stop analysis and comparison to previous versions began.\n\nThe secretive manual is only distributed to those who hold the position of\nElder. Showing the manual to anyone else is strictly forbidden.. Each\ncongregation is lead by a group of men known as the Body of Elders, all of whom\nhold the honored title. The manual instructs them in administering to their\ncongregation and how the Elders above them can assist in their duties. Topics\nalso include pornography, child abuse, and “medical matters”.\n\nAccording to Jason Wynne, founder of AvoidJW.org [https://avoidjw.org/],\nprevious versions of this manual left much “open to interpretation by bodies of\nelders,” but “the language has been significantly simplified to be clear,\nconcise and direct” in this latest edition.\n\nChild Sex Abuse\nOne notable and significant change lies in the chapter addressing child abuse.\nThe manual clearly states “the victim, her parents, or anyone else who reports\nsuch an allegation to the elders should be clearly informed that they have the\nright to report the matter to the secular authorities.”\n\nThis is undoubtedly a welcome change among abuse survivor advocates. While the\nfamily is not necessarily encouraged to go to the authorities, the mere\nrecognition of their right is an improvement in JW policy. There are countless\nstories in which survivors of sexual abuse and their families chose not  — in\nsome cases even actively discouraged — to report the incident to authorities\nbecause of JW beliefs that all organizations, outside the religion itself, are\ncorrupt.\n\nIn January 2018, Truth & Transparency released letters\n[https://faithleaks.org/newsroom/2018/01/09/faithleaks-releases-documents-surrounding-sexual-abuse-investigation-in-jehovahs-witness-congregation/] \nthoroughly documenting one such instance.\n\nBranch Manual\nIn addition to the already released Elders manual\n[https://faithleaks.org/wiki/documents/e/e1/2019-01-SHEPHERD_THE_FLOCK_OF_GOD.pdf]\n, today the Truth & Transparency also releases another internal manual\n[https://faithleaks.org/wiki/documents/f/f6/2018-08-Branch_Organization.pdf],\noften informally referred to as the “branch manual”. The January 2015\n[https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/EXH.029.028.0001_R.pdf] \nedition of the same manual was used as an exhibit in an investigation conducted\nby the Australian government into child sex abuse, but chapters four and five\nwere nearly entirely redacted. Today the largely revised August 2018 edition is\npublished without redactions.\n\nThis manual is only distributed to the highest leaders within Watch Tower (WT),\nthe governing JW organization. A group of eight men comprise the Governing Body,\nthe most senior leaders of the organization. Below them are six Branch\nCommittees, each responsible for administering a specific area of the worldwide\nreligion. The branch manual is for members of the Governing Body and the Branch\nCommittees only.\n\nJennifer Torres, an ex-JW, says that she would have benefited greatly as an\nactive JW from seeing this manual, especially as a woman. “If you were to ask a\nJW woman, they would have no idea how the Branch Committees affect them,” she\nsays.\n\nWhen Torres’ family experienced inappropriate interactions with leaders in her\ncongregation, they reported the problem, but it did not improve. Assuming the\nproblem was isolated to only their congregation they moved to a different one.\nThe problem persisted and little did she realize that it was systemic, something\nthat publicly publishing the branch manual would have empowered her to know and\nmake suggestions to correct it.\n\nData Privacy\nIn addition to the light shed on the systemic workings and problems of Watch\nTower (WT), Torres is interested to see if WT has changed their approach to the\ndestruction of records. The 2003 branch manual, leaked in 2011\n[https://jhonlemos.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/branch-organization-watchtower.pdf]\n, shows that they do not destroy records even if a JW voluntarily disassociates\nwith the Church.\n\nSuch policies have changed, undoubtedly in response to the European Union’s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The manual now states in Chapter 3\nparagraph 103(d):\n\n> “If a data subject requests access to, correction of, or deletion of personal\ndata or sensitive personal data about himself, the organization will fairly\nconsider granting the request by balancing the interests of the individual in\ngaining access or correcting or deleting data against the legitimate religious\ninterests of the organization, including whether granting the request would\nendanger the organization’s right to religious freedom and practice.”\nIn April 2018, Truth & Transparency released documents\n[https://faithleaks.org/newsroom/2018/04/10/faithleaks-releases-10-documents-revealing-watch-towers-response-to-gdpr/] \nin various European languages that Jehovah’s Witnesses in the EU were asked to\nsign. By doing so, they agree\n[https://faithleaks.org/wiki/documents/b/b4/2018-03-NOTICE_AND_CONSENT_FOR_USE_OF_PERSONAL_DATA-S-290-E.pdf] \nthat they “consent to the use of my personal data so that I may participate in\nsome religious activities in connection with my worship. . .”\n\nWatch Tower did not respond to request for comment before this story was\npublished.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nView the August 2018 branch manual here\n[https://faithleaks.org/wiki/documents/f/f6/2018-08-Branch_Organization.pdf].\n\nView the January 2018 branch manual here\n[https://faithleaks.org/wiki/documents/1/13/2018-01-Branch_Organization.pdf].\n\nView the January 2019 elders manual here\n[https://faithleaks.org/wiki/documents/e/e1/2019-01-SHEPHERD_THE_FLOCK_OF_GOD.pdf]\n.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520626891060-d6d92cf1f109?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-03-14T23:19:18.000Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T23:22:30.000Z","published_at":"2019-02-11T14:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none","newsletter_id":null},{"id":"5e95dc417d87e90038491dab","uuid":"8a3816d7-c1a8-4a40-b673-98a9be4a469f","title":"Director of Mormon Temple Videos and Sundance Festival Co-founder Admits to Child Molestation in Early 90s","slug":"director-of-mormon-temple-videos-and-sundance-festival-co-founder-admits-to-child-molestation-in-early-90s","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}],[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Van_Wagenen\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:2018-09-Sterling_Van_Wagenen-Audio.mp3\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://rsc.byu.edu/authors/brown-harold-c\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/1996-01-20/first-presidency-names-new-director-of-welfare-services-10830\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/09/a-chance-to-start-over-church-disciplinary-councils-and-the-restoration-of-blessings?lang=eng\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63G/Chapter2/63G-2-S302.html?v=C63G-2-S302_2018050820180508\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700102668/Utah-Valley-resident-Sterling-Van-Wagenen-was-there-before-Redford.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://faculty.utah.edu/u0868495-Sterling_G_Van_Wagenen/hm/index.hml\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owcUhWWdPCM&t=2s\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/01/02/lds-church-releases/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://excelentertainment.com/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8581198/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/how-mormons-approach-abuse\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/arts/sundance-founder-abuse-arrest.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:2018-09-Sterling_Van_Wagenen-Transcript.pdf\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:1993-07-26-SALT_LAKE_COUNTY_SHERIFFS_OFFICE-93-91448.pdf\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:1993-07-26-SALT_LAKE_COUNTY_SHERIFFS_OFFICE-93-91297.pdf\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://www.snapnetwork.org/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.rainn.org/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"While at a sleepover with a friend in 1993, David woke up in the middle of the night to something that would haunt him for the rest of his life.

The ceremonies that take place are rarely, if ever, talked about outside the temple. The principal ceremony is called the Endowment Ceremony. The Endowment, in part, serves as an instructional session to teach attendees about the foundations of the Earth’s creation and other core doctrines of the Church. This instruction is delivered by a movie played throughout the ceremony. Up until 2013, two videos rotated in these sessions, one was produced in 1988, the other in 1990.</p><p>In 2013 those two videos were replaced with three brand new films, all directed by Sterling Van Wagenen. Multiple sources involved in the production of these films told Truth &amp; Transparency that Van Wagenen was brought in by the Mormon Church to direct these movies in an effort to produce a high quality product. These sources tell Truth &amp; Transparency that, of the pool of possible directors, Van Wagenen was likely the best candidate to bring a high production value to the films due to his extensive experience in the film industry. Given the sacredness of these ceremonies, the selection of Van Wagenen implies good standing with the Church.</p><p>In January of 2019, due to <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/01/02/lds-church-releases/\">doctrinal changes</a> in the ceremony, the Mormon Church discontinued the use of the new videos in the Endowment Ceremony in favor of an audiovisual presentation that uses still images from the three movies directed by Van Wagenen.<br><br>In addition to directing the temple videos, Van Wagenen has directed or produced a number of films through <a href=\"https://excelentertainment.com/\">Excel Entertainment</a>, a for-profit subsidiary of the Mormon Church, including their most recent film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8581198/\">Jane and Emma</a>.</p><h2 id=\"life-after-abuse\">Life After Abuse</h2><p>David tells Truth &amp; Transparency that he was never contacted by Harold Brown or anyone else from the Mormon Church to check on his well being.

His friend’s\ndad had his hand down his pants and was rubbing his penis. He jumped up and ran\nto the bathroom. He was scared and did not know what to do. He spent the rest of\nthe night locked in the bathroom and the next 26 years traumatized by the events\nof that evening.\n\nThe perpetrator was Sterling Van Wagenen\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Van_Wagenen], a Mormon film producer and\nco-founder of the Sundance Film Festival, and, while he made a full confession\nof the crime to both his religious leader and the police, he never completely\nfaced justice. More importantly, David was never given the resources to properly\ncope with the trauma and heal.\n\nThe Abuse\nIn an audio\n[https://mormonleaks.io/wiki/index.php?title=File:2018-09-Sterling_Van_Wagenen-Audio.mp3] \nrecording  obtained by Truth & Transparency, Van Wagenen describes a double life\nhe lived for decades. When asked if he is a pedophile, Van Wagenen denies that\nlabel, but admits to multiple extramarital affairs with both men and women. He\nalso admits to one single instance of sex abuse perpetrated on a minor. That\nminor was David.\n\nDavid, whose name has been changed at his request, sought closure and reached\nout to his perpetrator through Van Wagenen’s children in an attempt to broker a\none-on-one meeting. Van Wagenen agreed to meet with him in September 2018.\nDavid, not knowing what to expect, decided to record the conversation. What\nensued was a candid conversation in which Van Wagenen was open about the\nincident and what he thinks may have led to it.\n\nVan Wagenen admits to having “acted out sexually” on many occasions. He cites\nbeing abused as a child by his mother as a contributing factor to this behavior.\nOn the night of the abusive act, he and his wife were arguing. He went\ndownstairs, where the kids were sleeping, and “acted out” by molesting David.\n\nVan Wagenen’s recollection of the details are fuzzy, but David fills them in\nduring the conversation. David says he woke up to Van Wagenen’s touch and, as he\nrealized what was happening, quickly ran to the bathroom, locking himself inside\nand spending the rest of the night there. David recalls Van Wagenen came to the\nbathroom door multiple times and urged him to exit. He was unsuccessful and\neventually went back upstairs.\n\nDavid mustered up the courage to tell his parents about the abuse. They went to\na mutual friend of Van Wagenen who they knew through their Mormon congregation.\nThis mutual friend informed Van Wagenen that he was going to tell the Stake\nPresident, Harold Brown, about the abuse. According to David, the friend, who\nwas a Bishop of a nearby, different congregation at the time, encouraged his\nparents to let the church handle the situation.\n\nConfession\nIn the recording Van Wagenen says that he was called into see Brown a few days\nafter the abuse.

However, that was\nnot the case.\n\nVan Wagenen claims he fully confessed to what he did and that a disciplinary\ncouncil ensued. The result was a two year disfellowshipment from the Church.\n\nDisfellowshipment is described\n[https://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/09/a-chance-to-start-over-church-disciplinary-councils-and-the-restoration-of-blessings?lang=eng] \nby the Mormon Church as:\n\n> “...the council may take is to disfellowship the member.

While the church has never been listed among the largest private\nlandowners in the US, this newly compiled data places them in the top five in\nterms of acreage and likely number one in terms of market value.\n\nTruth & Transparency’s investigation reveals that, in July 2020, the LDS Church\nowned 1,754,633 acres across the country with a minimum market value of $15.7\nbillion. 15,963 parcels across the country have been linked to the Church\nthrough public records. Roughly 50 percent of the parcels consist of\nagricultural zoning. The other half is primarily made up of commercial or\nreligious zoning. \n\nWhile initially looking into a handful of properties known to be owned by the\nUtah-based church, a common data point was discovered: a single address that was\nassociated with each property, regardless of the legal entity that owned it.\nWorking under the hypothesis that this single address could be the key to\nmapping all—or at least a large portion—of the church’s landholdings, Truth &\nTransparency tapped into a database compiled by Reonomy. A New York City-based\ntechnology company, Reonomy is considered a “leading provider of [commercial\nreal estate] insights, empowering top brokerages, financial institutions, and\ncommercial services providers with actionable data and solutions”. Using this\ncommon data point, Truth & Transparency uncovered the parcels mentioned above\nthrough Reonomy.\n\nIn order to obtain the highest level of confidence in the integrity of the data,\nTruth & Transparency manually verified every property with a market value of at\nleast $20 million and another 1,000 randomly selected samples from the remaining\npopulation.\n\nReonomy’s records do not include properties zoned for single family residences\nnor do they claim the data is completely comprehensive. For example, the Chicago\nLDS temple in Glenview, IL does not show up in the query. It is unclear what\nwould preclude properties that share the same common data point to not be\nincluded in the query. Furthermore, it is possible that there are other\nproperties in the US that are owned by the church that are not associated with\nthe common address. Thus, the properties found should be considered the Mormon\nChurch’s minimum landholdings in July 2020.\n\nOver the years, there has been some reporting on large portions of the Church’s\nlandholdings. For example, in 2013 Reuters reported that the Mormon Church was\nset to become the largest private landowner in Florida. In 2017 the Dallas\nMorning News reported on a commercial property that the Church purchased for\n$100 million. However, Truth & Transparency is unaware of any attempt to compile\nall LDS real estate assets across the US before now. \n\nWhen the data is populated into an interactive map, the largess of the church’s\nreal estate empire can be jarring.\n\nInteractive map created by Ethan Gregory Dodge [https://www.egd.io/]. To explore\nit full screen, click the button in the top right corner.\n\nThe interactive map and its accompanying data—publicly searchable here\n[https://bit.io/egd/lds-landholdings]— will prove to be  useful tools to those\nlooking to further our reporting. Additionally, the information adds to the\ngrowing library of investigative reports that have shed light and knowledge on\nthe church’s assets, something they have tried to keep as quiet as possible over\nthe years according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nA representative from the LDS Church did not respond to our request for comment\nbefore the publication of this article.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nA few caveats to remember when reviewing the map and data:\n\n * This data is based on county records as of July 21, 2020. There are\n   properties purchased in early 2020 and after this date that are not present\n   in the data. For absent properties purchased prior to July 21, 2020, it is\n   likely due to the county records not yet reflecting the change in ownership.\n   An example of this would be the 15,000 acre Texas ranch the Church purchased\n   in early 2020.\n * Any properties owned by the LDS Church with “Single Family Residence” zoning\n   designation would be in addition to the properties in this dataset. There are\n   a few properties on the list that would fit the traditional description of\n   “Single Family Residence'', but they are not zoned as such.\n * The \"Asset Category\" designation reflects what the official county records\n   show. Not all counties are perfect in keeping those designations up to date.\n   Some properties may have asset designations that do not accurately reflect\n   their intended or actual use.\n * Reonomy cannot guarantee that it captures every property. This means that\n   there are properties (other than single family residences) owned by the LDS\n   Church that don’t show up in the dataset. An example of this would be the\n   Chicago temple. We were unable to determine what caused some properties to\n   not show up in our query results.\n * The numbers labeled “Total Assessed Value” and “Total Market Value” are\n   reported by each county. Counties across the country use different methods\n   when calculating these numbers. Furthermore, 2,291 properties have no value\n   assigned to them by their county. These values should be considered a\n   baseline when trying to evaluate the total value of these properties.\n * These properties were able to be aggregated due to the common address we\n   discovered that they all share. It is possible that there are properties\n   owned by the LDS church that do not share this address.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate, April 5, 2022 1:30 pm PST: The original data included an office building\nin Provo, Utah with a market value of $76 million.
